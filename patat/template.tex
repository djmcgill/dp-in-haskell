\begin{abstract}
In many cases it is far more important to quickly produce correct and robust
code than to optimise code for performance. One such area is prototyping
heuristics and algorithms for combinatorial optimisation. This paper
investigates the use of Haskell to this end.

We use Haskell to implement standard dynamic programming algorithms, including
bounded and unbounded knapsack, and column generation. Then we
compare with implementations in Java and C in terms of speed, conciseness,
modularity, as well as ease of parallelisation, refactoring, debugging and
reasoning. To make the comparisons fair we keep the structure of the code
similar across languages, except when taking advantage of specific language
features (e.g., pointers, objects or laziness). The implementations are
idiomatic and representative of an 'average' user, without non- portable
micro-optimisations. In particular, standard libraries are used throughout for
floating-point arithmetic and non-trivial data structures.

Our preliminary results (unbounded knapsack in C and Haskell) show that while
the C code is about four times faster, using Haskell for prototyping indeed
offers significant advantages in terms of speed of development and eliminating
certain classes of errors, without incurring a performance penalty that is
unacceptable for a prototype.
