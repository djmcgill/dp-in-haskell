\section{Preliminary Results}
Our preliminary results (unbounded knapsack in C and Haskell) show that while
the C code is about four times faster, using Haskell for prototyping indeed
offers significant advantages in terms of speed of development and eliminating
certain classes of errors, without incurring a performance penalty that is
unacceptable for a prototype.
