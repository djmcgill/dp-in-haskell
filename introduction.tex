\section{Introduction}

% HN 2014-02-22: This is a revised version of the first part of the initial
% abstract. It's a nice pitch, but probably a better fit for the introduction
% rather than a terse abstract.

Over the last decades, the speed of computers has increased by many orders of
magnitude, but the speed of the typical programmer has not. In many cases it
is far more important to quickly produce correct and robust code than to eke
out every last bit of performance from a program, and as computers continue to
become more powerful, while humans will essentially remain the same, this is
ultimately going to become the norm. We argue that prototyping new heuristics
and algorithms for combinatorial optimisation is one area where speed of
development of correct code is already more important than absolute
performance. As an example, there was a high profile cases recently in which a
software bug has caused erroneous results to be published.
